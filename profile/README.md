Test Accounts with Partial Access

In order to simulate the standard user and administrator roles within a specific department, test accounts with limited access are established. Administrator accounts possess full access to all functionalities within their respective departmental domains, whereas user accounts are restricted to accessing only the data that is relevant to their roles. This segregation of roles ensures that access to sensitive information is restricted to authorized personnel only, thus enhancing the security of departmental assets.
